      I am currently studying to become a front-end developer at KYH in Liljeholmen, with the goal of creating intuitive and user-friendly web applications. I have developed a strong interest in technology and design, building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am continuously working to deepen my knowledge in modern frameworks like React and Next.js.

      I live in Nacka with my husband and two children, which has taught me how to effectively balance studies and family life. My previous professional experiences have honed my ability to be organized, responsive, responsible, and focused under pressure. I look forward to applying my skills in a new professional environment and contributing to the development of innovative and user-centered solutions.
